# Quant Finance

# Basically use math, stats, and programming to analyze finanical markets, manage risk, and design trading strategies.

# Quants used data-drien models to make testable and decisions.

- Study the past
- Model the randomness of price
- Simulate possible outcomes using statisitcal tehcniques
- Turn data into decisions through mathematical models and code

# Core models

- Time-Series Modeling:
- Predicting future prices using historical prices
- Monte carlo simulation: estimating probabilties by simualting thousands of possible outocmes
- Black scholes model: a mathematical formual used to price options
- Portfolio optimization: Finding the best balances between risk and return
- Risk Mdoels: Measuring exposure using emtrics like var

double interestRate = 0.0525;  // 5.25% interest rate double principal = 100000.0;   // Principal amount in dollars   ●     double tells the compiler to store a floating-point number (a number that can have decimals). ●     interestRate and principal are the variable names. ●     The values (0.0525, 100000.0) are stored in memory.
